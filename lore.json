      "description": "A vast, layered world of crumbling empires, wild frontiers, ancient forests, storm-wracked seas, and sorcerous cities. Magic is real but always exacts a price. The dead linger. Shadows have will. Gods are distant but not absent. Beneath the grim surface, wonder persists \u2014 in fae-touched glades, dragon-guarded peaks, bustling trade ports, and the stubborn courage of ordinary people.",
      "tone": "Sword & sorcery pulp \u2014 Howard, Smith, Leiber, with room for wonder, romance, humor, and hope alongside the darkness. Muscular prose, doomed heroes AND unlikely victors, ironic endings AND earned triumphs.",
      "rules": [
        "Magic always exacts a price \u2014 in blood, memory, years, or something less tangible.",
        "Shadow-magic is real; shadows can be stolen, sold, worn, or inhabited by other entities.",
        "Some treasure carries supernatural debt \u2014 curses that compound, pursue across generations, and cannot be escaped through conventional repayment. Most gold is just gold; the danger is never knowing which kind you hold.",
        "Demons deal in intangibles: years of life, happiness, certainty, loyalty.",
        "The dead can return to honor \u2014 or collect on \u2014 oaths sworn in life.",
        "Living architecture exists: structures that breathe, digest, or grow around the living.",
        "World-crossing is possible through rare magical catastrophe or demonic contract, but is never casual.",
        "The Fae Courts exist beyond mortal borders \u2014 capricious, beautiful, and bound by their own alien rules of hospitality and debt.",
        "Dragons are ancient, intelligent, and political \u2014 they hoard not just gold but secrets, oaths, and bloodlines.",
        "The sea has its own powers: merfolk nations, drowned gods, tide-magic, and currents that remember.",
        "Non-human peoples (dwarves, goblins, orcs, smallfolk, and others) have their own cultures, grudges, and ambitions \u2014 they are not merely monsters.",
        "Gods exist but rarely intervene directly; their priests and temples wield real but constrained divine power, and theological disputes can spark wars.",
        "Alchemy is a discipline distinct from sorcery \u2014 it transforms matter, brews poisons and cures, and can grant temporary abilities at physical cost.",
        "Prophecy is unreliable but influential \u2014 seers exist, their visions are fragmentary and often misinterpreted, and people wage wars over readings.",
        "Music, art, and spoken word can carry genuine magical weight \u2014 bardic magic, rune-carving, and name-magic are recognized traditions.",
        "Trade routes are the arteries of civilization \u2014 merchant guilds, caravan masters, and smuggler networks hold real political power.",
        "Nature is not passive: ancient forests resist axes, beast-spirits guard wild places, druids broker between civilization and the wild, and seasons can be weaponized by those who know the old ways.",
        "Fellowship matters: oaths of companionship, war-bands, thieves' guilds, and sworn crews carry real weight and real magic \u2014 betraying a fellowship-bond has consequences as severe as breaking any other oath."
