      "text": "Kael the Nameless had worn a hundred shadows\u2014borrowed faces, stolen identities, lives worn like cloaks. In the gambling dens of Xul'thyris, shadow-broking paid well. But shadows remember their owners.\n\nWhen the merchant prince came offering triple wages for a specific shadow\u2014that of the city's High Magistrate\u2014Kael should have refused. Instead, he crept into the magistrate's villa and severed the man's shadow from candlelight and stone.\n\nIt writhed in his possession, shrieking without voice. Three days later, the magistrate died, and his shadow began to hunger. It ate Kael's stolen identities one by one, and with them, his memories. Each morning he woke less himself. The shadow, now fat with stolen life, began to wear him instead.\n\nOn the seventh night, Kael looked in the mirror and saw only darkness wearing skin. He was still smiling when the shadow-broker came to collect payment. Some debts exact interest in flesh.",

      "text": "Mordica the Bone-Carver had sculpted the dead for forty years\u2014crafting totems that bound vengeful spirits, carving phylacteries for desperate sorcerers. She asked no questions. Gold spoke louder than conscience.\n\nThen came the widow with her daughter's remains and eyes like frozen coals. \"Bind her here,\" she demanded, placing a small femur on Mordica's table. \"Make her suffer as she suffered.\"\n\nMordica carved through the night\u2014symbols of anguish etched into that small bone, incantations whispered in the Old Tongue. The widow paid triple and vanished.\n\nSoon the widow returned with new commissions: a husband's rib, a sister's spine. Each bound with malice. Each payment heavier than the last. And Mordica's hands began to age\u2014first the fingers, then the wrists. The carving had a price.\n\nOn the fortieth day, her hands were skeletal husks. The widow appeared in her mirror, smiling. \"Thank you, old woman. You've built my family's monument in bone and suffering. Now it's your turn to be carved.\"\n\nMordica's screams lasted through the night.",

      "text": "Yareth rode the blasted steppes for three seasons, chasing rumors of her brother's fate. The khan's armies had swallowed him during the war for the Sunken Wells. No corpse ever surfaced. No ransom was demanded.\n\nIn the crumbling ruins of Old Keth, a figure emerged from the sand\u2014neither male nor female, its skin bearing the sheen of wet leather. \"Your brother lives,\" it said, voice like wind through bone. \"He tends the gardens of the Underlords, deep where roots drink blood. I can return him. For seven years of your joy.\"\n\nYareth's sword trembled. Seven years was a lifetime on the steppes. But her brother\u2014\n\nShe accepted. The bargain sealed itself in her blood.\n\nHer brother returned, unchanged and smiling, speaking in whispers of impossible flowers and the Underlords' kindness. But Yareth felt it immediately: a hollowing in her chest, each laugh turned to ash, each victory tasting of copper.\n\nWorse, her brother no longer remembered her name. He followed always, an echo wearing her brother's face, collecting the joy she'd bartered away. Some prices, once paid, consume the currency for eternity.",

Caros the Fortunate found it by accident while fleeing the city guard.\n\nThree days of joy: wine, women, fine steel. On the fourth day, the Collector arrived.\n\nIt wore a merchant's cloak and carried a ledger of grey parchment. \"Morthaxes's gold,\" it said, producing a coin from Caros's stash. \"The debt compounds. You owe one coin now. Tomorrow, two. The day after, four.\" It smiled, if that expression could grace something so hollow. \"The Lich-King is patient. But his patience is expensive.\"\n\nCaros tried to spend the coins, to shed them like cursed skin. They returned. He attempted to melt them\u2014they reformed. By the sixteenth day, he owed more than existed in the world.\n\nThe Collector came each morning with updated sums, watching with amusement as Caros's hair whitened and his flesh withered. \"The Lich-King collects in flesh when gold runs dry,\" it observed conversationally.\n\nWhen the guard finally cut Caros down, they found him smiling. The Collector had already claimed the best part of the bargain: his despair.",

      "text": "The Tomb of Shard-V\u00eal wasn't built\u2014it grew. Stone and flesh fused centuries ago into something breathing, something aware. Morg had kept vigil for twelve years, one of a lineage of tomb-keepers sworn in blood-oath to guard what slumbered within.\n\nThen the Plague Wars ended, and no new keepers came.\n\nMorg felt the tomb's hunger first as a whisper in the walls. The stone began to digest the lesser guardians\u2014the skeletal servants and bound ghosts who served as first defense. They were reabsorbed. The tomb contracted around Morg like a fist.\n\n\"Release me,\" came a voice from the depths, not with words but through the trembling stone itself. \"The threat has passed. Release me.\"\n\nBut Morg's oath had been sealed in his own blood, by his own hand. The tomb was sacred. He could not break his word\u2014not while breath remained.\n\nSo the tomb consumed him instead, slowly, piece by piece. Each day Morg sank deeper into the living stone, becoming less man and more part of the architecture itself. Eventually, he understood: he had always been part of the tomb's digestion. His oath had simply delayed the meal.\n\nNow his bones line the burial chamber. His consciousness still warns visitors away. The tomb is satisfied.",

      "text": "The plague-village of Carrion's Rest was dying\u2014children blackened with septic rot, mothers beyond screaming. Sister Kess came with herbs and prayers. When both failed, she broke her novitiate oath and sought the Witch of Ravenmoor.\n\nThe witch was ancient, her eyes like coins dropped in still water. \"Mercy for the village. That will cost you,\" she rasped. \"Name it.\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Kess breathed.\n\nThe witch drew a knife of blackthorn and opened Kess's arm. Blood spilled onto soil. \"Your ability to lie. Gone. Every word true, forever.\" The witch smiled. \"You'll wish death took you instead.\"\n\nThe plague lifted. The village was saved. Kess returned to the convent a hero.\n\nBut her curse became torment. She could not offer false comfort to the dying. Could not tell her superior she loved the order when duty had become bitter. Could not claim piety when doubt gnawed her bones. Every confession extracted truths that shattered faith\u2014hers and others'.\n\nWorse, she could not lie about the price. Every survivor she healed from that day forward heard the full bargain of their cure.\n\nWithin a year, no one sought her healing. Kess died\u2014not from plague, but from a truth too heavy to bear. The witch, watching from a crow's body, cawed approval. Mercy always demands the cruelest honesty.",

The land itself belonged to her dead husband\u2014Velgrim the Terrible, who had died three seasons past but refused the courtesy of finality.\n\nHis ghost was practical. He appeared at war councils and insisted on continuing the siege of Blackthorn. He walked the ramparts at dawn, noting weaknesses in the defenses. He demanded his generals' loyalty and collected tribute in coin and blood-oath.\n\nKessara was but a regent. A steward in her own halls.\n\nWhen the Blackthorn garrison finally broke and offered surrender, Velgrim's shade demanded not mercy but massacre. Kessara's generals looked to her. The choice was hers\u2014honor her husband's word or face his fury.\n\nShe chose a third path. That night, she performed a ritual of dismissal\u2014an ancient rite requiring the sacrifice of something precious. She gave what mattered most: her claim to the Marches. The title, the land, the crown. She spoke the words of release, and Velgrim's ghost, satisfied at last that his legacy was secured, departed to the peaceful dead.\n\nKessara left at dawn, a wanderer once more. Behind her, the Sunken Marches prospered under a ghost-king's eternal rule. She never looked back.",

Voluntary sacrifice. He found willing candidates among the desperate and desperate-poor. They drank his gold and wept with gratitude.\n\nThe first draughts succeeded beyond measure. His hair blackened. His wrinkles faded. At seventy, he looked forty.\n\nBut the appetite grew.\n\nWhat had required one sacrifice monthly now demanded weekly donations. The gold ran out. He turned to theft, then coercion. The transformation was inevitable\u2014the potion rewriting his hunger, his morality, his very nature. He became something that fed on flesh as a matter of being.\n\nWhen the city guard finally cornered him in his tower, Lethyn was scarcely human anymore\u2014skin stretched tight, fingers elongated into appendages that tasted the air. He had achieved perfect youth. He had also become a thing that could not stop consuming.\n\nThey burned the tower with him inside. The flames didn't slow him; the fire became part of his alchemy, transmuting agony into hunger. His screams lasted three days. In the ashes, something was still breathing, still yearning. Some works of alchemy can never be undone\u2014only abandoned to burn and burn again.",

For five years he kept the vigil, holding back the Rot-King's forces from the border towns.\n\nThen came the messenger with a sealed letter\u2014orders from the Crown. Abandon Grimmholt. The fortress was to be surrendered without contest.\n\nThorne felt the oath twist in his chest like a blade. Obey the Crown, he would break his sacred vow. Refuse, he would face execution for treason. Either path meant spiritual death.\n\nHe chose a third: rebellion. He sealed the gates, declared himself warden independent of the Crown, and held against both the Rot-King and the royal armies for two years. The magic of his oath kept him vital, driven by rage and grim duty.\n\nWhen the fortress finally fell\u2014betrayed from within by soldiers loyal to the Crown\u2014Thorne stood alone on the burning rampart. The oath, satiated by his defiance and ultimate sacrifice, released him as his blood soaked the stone.\n\nHe died unburdened. Sometimes the only way to honor an oath is to break every law protecting it.",

She could walk on waves, summon floods, speak to drowning men. The merfolk wanted payment. They always did.\n\nFor three years she evaded them, hiring sellswords and sorcerers. Then she learned the truth: you cannot steal from the sea. It simply waits. It is patient. It reclaims.\n\nIn the desert city of Vel-Karsh, ten thousand miles from any ocean, the merfolk came for her. They walked on sand as if it were water, their forms shimmering between liquid and solid. They had come to collect.\n\nNara's magic turned against her. The water in her blood rose in rebellion. She could feel herself beginning to drown from within, becoming the payment itself. Desperate, she performed a last ritual\u2014binding her stolen magic into a single artifact: a glass vial containing one tear of the Sapphire Deep.\n\nShe shattered it against the earth. The resulting flood swallowed the merfolk and Nara both. When the waters retreated, they left her on a beach three continents away\u2014alive, powerless, and whole. The merfolk had accepted the world's transformation as payment. Some debts are best settled by reshaping the land itself.",
