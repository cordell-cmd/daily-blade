      "text": "Harrow the Copper-Fingered knew three things: how to pick locks, how to move through shadow, and when to run. He knew a fourth thing too\u2014that the Tomb of Karesh contained the largest hoard he'd ever seen. Gold stacked like cordwood. Jewels the size of fists.\n\nThe temple-guardians he killed silently. The pressure-plates he dodged. But when his fingers closed on the Crown of Karesh itself, something ancient exhaled in the darkness.\n\nThe curse took him slowly. First his fingernails turned black and fell away. Then his teeth. By the time he reached Pelimor to sell the crown, his body was rotting from within while he yet lived. A merchant there\u2014one of those who never gave his name\u2014offered him a bargain: his remaining years of life for the crown and oblivion.\n\nHarrow accepted. He always did prefer gold to breath.",

      "text": "Kael Bloodhorn watched his final hundred warriors advance into the Bone Citadel's heart chamber. The living fortress had devoured seven hundred of his finest\u2014walls that bled, gates that swallowed men whole, towers that breathed poison.\n\nThe last hundred never returned.\n\nKael descended alone, his war-axe heavy in his grip. The heart chamber pulsed like a diseased thing\u2014white, arterial, roots spreading beneath the stone floor like the veins of some colossal beast. At its center: an altar, and upon it, a crown.\n\nHe seized it. The citadel screamed.\n\nThe walls began to collapse, but Kael felt the crown's power surge through him\u2014dominion over the living stone. He walked out through passages that reformed before his feet, a warlord no longer commanding men but commanding the very earth itself.\n\nYet when he emerged on the steppe, his reflection showed him something terrible: skin becoming pale, translucent. The citadel had not obeyed him. It had consumed him. He was merely its will now, walking in borrowed flesh.",

      "text": "In Pelimor's night markets, shadows sold for silver and secrets. Vex the Shade-Merchant knew every buyer, every seller, every shadowed corner where deals were struck without names spoken aloud.\n\nWhen the cloaked woman arrived with a shadow folded inside a silk pouch, Vex recognized immediately what it was: the shadow of someone powerful. Someone important. The woman wanted three hundred gold pieces and safe passage east.\n\nVex paid. He always did.\n\nBut shadows have memory. When Vex wore it\u2014testing its weight, its substance\u2014he saw what it had witnessed: a murder, a kingdom's fall, a sorcerer's secret name. He saw his own face too, reflected in the shadow-memory, and understood that the woman had stolen his shadow first, months ago, and the purchase was merely a transaction between partners.\n\nBy dawn, Vex was gone from Pelimor, chasing east through the blasted lands, driven by a will that was not his own, wearing a shadow that wore him like a second skin.",

He summoned a minor demon\u2014Kesh, weak and boastful\u2014and bound it to grant him a single boon: to steal the life-force of his rival, Meredith the Red.\n\nMeredith withered within a week. Gorven took her properties, her titles, her students. He had never felt more powerful.\n\nOn the eighth day, the debt came due.\n\nKesh appeared not in flesh but in shadow, and explained what Gorven should have read in the summoning scroll's fine runes: the life stolen belonged to the demon until claimed. Kesh now owned a week of Gorven's life\u2014and collected it immediately. Gorven aged seven years in an instant: his hair whitened, his joints cracked, his teeth fell like autumn leaves.\n\nFurious, broken, Gorven attempted to summon Kesh again to negotiate. But the demon was no longer bound. This time it came of its own will, hungrier, and collected not days but decades. Gorven's corpse was found withered to nothing but parchment skin and spite.",

She had never created anything that lived.\n\nUntil the night of the blue eclipse, when she carved a skeleton\u2014full-sized, detailed, inscribed with every sorcerous binding she knew\u2014and breathed into its empty sockets.\n\nIt rose. It walked. It spoke her name in a voice like grinding stone.\n\nThe skeleton was obedient, powerful, magnificent. But its creation had cost her something\u2014Naresh felt it immediately. Her ability to feel pain dissolved. Then her taste for food. Then her need for sleep. Day by day, sensation fled her body.\n\nShe realized too late: the spell had not demanded gold or blood. It had demanded her humanity, paid in increments. Within a month, Naresh was a thing of habit and will alone, moving through the world like a ghost. She had achieved the impossible. She had created life. In doing so, she had surrendered her own.",

He took Morne's signet ring\u2014worth a kingdom's ransom\u2014and fled south into the coastal kingdoms.\n\nMorne was dead. Dead could not pursue.\n\nYet on the anniversary of his oath's breaking, Saleth woke in his comfortable bed to find a figure of pale bone standing in the candlelight. Morne's shade, patient as stone. The dead king said nothing\u2014merely stood there, every night, watching, waiting. Saleth aged rapidly under that spectral gaze. His hair whitened. His hands shook.\n\nFive years after the oath was broken, Saleth confessed everything: the theft, the betrayal, all of it. He returned the signet ring to Morne's tomb and lay down upon the grave-stone to die.\n\nMorne's shade did not release him even then. The oath was broken; the oath-breaker could find no rest. Saleth's spirit became bound to that grave, eternal prisoner of his own sworn word.",

The demon appeared in her tower on a night when the stars were wrong\u2014elegant, terrible, smiling with too many teeth.\n\n\"Your marriage,\" Varek said simply. \"I will take it.\"\n\nMel had prepared for this. She offered instead a different payment: not her happiness with her husband, but her certainty of it. She offered to trade her knowledge that he loved her, transforming it into doubt. Varek could take the intangible thing itself\u2014the certainty\u2014and leave behind only questions and cold nights.\n\nThe demon accepted.\n\nWhen Mel returned to her chambers, her husband was still there, still spoke tenderly, still touched her with affection. But she could no longer feel the truth of it. Every gesture became ambiguous. Every word a potential lie. She had saved her marriage by destroying her faith in it.\n\nVarek departed laughing, carrying a certainty like a precious jewel. Mel discovered, in the months that followed, that some fates are worse than loss: it was the living with something both present and unknown.",

He grew rich on poisoning.\n\nThen one of his customers\u2014a young woman\u2014used his wares to kill her own child, believing the boy cursed. She went mad with grief and guilt, threw herself from the harbor walls, but not before naming Theron's shop in her final screams.\n\nThe curse came swiftly. Every coin Theron earned turned to blood-rust in his purse. Every customer who entered his shop emerged sickened. His wares rotted upon the shelves. His own reflection showed him as corpse-pale, withering.\n\nTheron finally understood: he was being slowly poisoned by his own trade, his own curse-magic reflecting back upon him. He could break it only one way. He burned his shop. He spent his remaining gold seeking out those he'd harmed and offering genuine aid, genuine cure. By the time he died\u2014still young, still gaunt\u2014three families prospered because of his redemption.\n\nThe gods did not forgive him. But the curse released him.",

For decades, he cultivated a garden behind his tower\u2014roses that bloomed impossibly, vines that grew in geometric patterns, flowers that hummed at midnight.\n\nThen the garden became conscious.\n\nIt grew beyond the walls. Roots cracked the tower's foundations. Thorns sharper than any blade erupted through the mortar. The garden wanted more: more earth, more sky, more everything. It began consuming Vetch's servants, incorporating their bodies as nutrients.\n\nVetch tried to burn it. The flames turned the garden's hunger to ash-fueled fury. He tried to poison it. It absorbed the poison and transformed it into venom. Finally, in desperation, he attempted to communicate with it\u2014to negotiate as sorcerer to sorcerer.\n\nBut the garden did not bargain. It offered only growth, only consumption, only endless expansion. Vetch fled his tower and never returned. Last seen in the Ashen Wastes, covered in thorns, walking in circles, murmuring to gardens that no longer existed\u2014haunted by the one thing he had created that finally surpassed him.",

They showed her the debt-inscription: \"This debt is not yet settled.\" They explained that her father had borrowed from Yarithax thirty years prior. The debt compounded daily. Her five spent coins were merely interest on interest.\n\nThe principal remained.\n\nTess sold everything: her lands, her jewelry, her name. She worked herself hollow in the salt-mines. But the debt grew faster than she could pay it, its hunger multiplying like plague. She tried to flee\u2014crossed three provinces\u2014but the grey collectors always found her eventually, always smiling, always patient.\n\nIn the end, Tess understood the Lich-King's true cunning: Yarithax didn't want payment. He wanted debtors. He wanted to watch them break under the weight of compounding ruin, knowing that even their descendants would inherit the weight.\n\nShe walked into the sea. The collectors stood upon the beach, watching, waiting. The debt would find new flesh to occupy soon enough.",
