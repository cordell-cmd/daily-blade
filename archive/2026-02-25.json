      "title": "The Thief of Khar-Zul",
      "subgenre": "Sword & Sorcery",
      "text": "Vraxen the Knife had robbed a hundred merchant princes, but never a god. The idol of Khar-Zul squatted in the temple's inner dark, its nine emerald eyes worth more than most kingdoms. He pried the first gem free. The stone was warmâobscenely so. By the third, the shadows were moving. By the sixth, they had teeth. Vraxen sprinted for the portico, the remaining three eyes blazing at his back like green suns. He burst into moonlight, gems clutched to his chest. Behind him the temple screamed in a voice of grinding granite. He ran until his lungs tore. At dawn, camped in a dry riverbed, he counted his prize: six emeralds. He did not count the new shadow that crouched beside him, patient as carved stone, wearing the shape of his own face."

      "subgenre": "Dark Fantasy",
      "text": "The merchant Aldric paid Soraya the sell-sword in gold to escort his spice caravan across the Ashen Wastes. He paid the bandits in silver to let it pass. He paid the toll-lord in promises. When the caravan crested the final ridge above Pelimor, Soraya discovered he'd also paid a blood-sorcerer in something far more precious. The drivers' shadows were wrongâtoo thick, too still. One by one they turned, eyes like tarnished coins. Soraya killed nine men that night, weeping, because she'd eaten beside them for three weeks. She killed the sorcerer last, slowly. She kept none of Aldric's gold. But she took his shadow, rolled it tight as a scroll, and sold it in the night markets of Pelimor to a buyer who never gave his name. She told herself it was justice. Some nights she believed it."

      "text": "Below the Sunken Ziggurat of Yeng, in a chamber where the air tasted of centuries, Malachite Doss found the lamp. It was iron, ugly, and full of something that was not oil. The inscription above the niche read: He who lights this buys one truth at the cost of one lie he has lived by. Doss was a scholar. He had lived by many lies. He struck flint. The flame burned black. The truth that came was smallâhis dead wife had not loved him, only his library. He'd known this for thirty years without knowing it. The lie that the flame consumed was larger: the belief that knowledge was its own reward. He stood in the dark long after the lamp guttered out. Then he climbed toward the surface, lighter and heavier at once, already wondering what lay beneath the next sealed door."

      "text": "Kael Bloodhorn brought eight hundred Veth warriors to the walls of the Bone Citadel and lost six hundred of them before he understood the fortress was alive. The towers breathed. The gates digested. He lost another hundred learning where the heart wasâa pulsing white chamber deep beneath the foundation, fed by roots that spread under the whole steppe. He sent his last hundred in through the drainage tunnels with torches. They did not come back. But the Citadel screamed. It screamed for three days. On the fourth morning it was still, and Kael walked its corridors alone. He found his warriors in the wallsâabsorbed, preserved, their faces visible beneath the bone-white surface like insects in amber. They were breathing. He spent the rest of his life trying to get them out. He failed. But he never stopped."

      "text": "Every coin from Yarithax's hoard bore the Lich-King's profile and a small inscription on the reverse: This debt is not yet settled. Tessaly Dorn had spent twelve of them before she read the fine print. By then the collectors had found her. They were not impressiveâtwo thin men in grey, carrying ledgers. But they could walk through walls, and they never slept, and the debt they quoted in their dry voices compounded daily at a rate that would consume kingdoms. She offered them her soul. They consulted their ledgers. They shook their heads. A soul, they explained, was worth considerably less than twelve gold marks of Yarithax. She offered them ten years of her life. They noted it down, subtracted, and told her she still owed nine months, fourteen days, and several hours. She paid in service. Eleven months chasing debts for the dead. She collected punctually. She understood the job."

      "text": "Pieter Vane broke his oath to the dead king on a Tuesday, for twenty gold pieces and a horse. He spent the gold in a month. The horse went lame. The dead king came for him on a Wednesday. He was patient about itâdeath gives perspective on time. He found Pieter in a dockside tavern, three provinces away, and sat down across from him with the quiet ease of a man with nowhere else to be. He did not threaten. He merely asked if Pieter remembered the exact words of the oath. Pieter recited them, slowly, because he had not forgottenâhad never for one moment forgotten. The dead king nodded. Then you know what comes next. Pieter did. He'd known since Tuesday. He finished his drink. He paid his tab. He followed the dead king out into the cold street, and no one ever saw Pieter Vane again, though travelers sometimes reported a new tomb, unmarked, on the north road."

      "subgenre": "Witch Hunt",
      "text": "Conjuress Mel owed the demon Varek three favors for three spells cast in desperation during the Siege of Amrath. She'd counted on Varek forgetting. Demons, she'd reasoned, were busy. The first favor was small: deliver a letter to a dead man. She managed it. The second was moderate: steal a year from a sleeping child. She refused, and spent a month being reminded why refusal was inadvisable. She stole the year. The third favor Varek named on her wedding morning. He stood in the church door, elegant as plague, and named his price: the marriage itself. Happiness, he explained, was more valuable than years or letters. It was his finest collection. She drew the circle fastâshe'd had months to prepare itâand took the fourth option no mortal ever considered: she offered Varek herself, in contract, as a fellow collector. He paused. He was genuinely surprised. He agreed. It was a better arrangement for them both."

      "text": "Urgha the Unmoved killed four men before breakfast on the day she showed mercy, which tells you something about her mornings. The fifth man was the emperor's tax collector, small and damp and weeping, and he was weeping because his daughter was ill and he'd spent the collection on physicians and didn't know what to tell the emperor. Urgha had been hired by the emperor to retrieve the funds or the collector's ears. She stood in the muddy courtyard for a long time. She was not known for standing. She went inside and looked at the daughter, who was six and burning with fever and who looked, in the particular way of feverish children, like everyone's child. Urgha left the courtyard with neither money nor ears. She sent her own physicianâshe had one, mercenaries often didâand paid for it herself. She remained unmoved. She was very, very angry about the mercy for years afterward."

      "text": "The demon offered Cassia Vorn the usual things first: wealth, power, the life of her enemy. She declined each in turn with the brisk efficiency of someone who'd read the relevant literature. The demon, unused to educated clients, grew uncertain. What do you want? it finally asked, dropping the sales pitch. She told it: the name of the man who'd burned Crimson Gate, her city, with three thousand people still inside. The demon went still. Names, it said, carefully, were expensive. Not power or gold, but informationâinformation was the coin of a different, older economy. She said she understood. She offered the thing the demon actually wanted: not her soul, which was common, but her certainty. She was the most certain person the demon had ever met, and certainty in a mortal was intoxicating to beings made of doubt. She left with the name. She became notably less certain afterward, but she used the name, and that was enough."

      "text": "King Aldous III won the war by importing the Plague-Bringer's Crown from the sealed vault beneath Ostern and setting it on his head for thirty seconds. Thirty seconds was, the scholars assured him, survivable. They were nearly right. He won. The enemy kingdom surrendered before the siege engines were deployed, because an army that watches its opponent crown himself with a relic that killed four previous wearers understands it faces a man with nothing left to lose. Aldous reigned for eleven more years. He was not a good kingâhe was erratic, sleepless, prone to speaking to people who were not in the roomâbut he was a king no one ever tried to depose. When he died, finally, of ordinary causes, the physicians found his shadow had been on backwards for years, which explained certain things. The Crown was returned to Ostern. They built a deeper vault."

His soul, bound in parchment written in blood.\n\nHe signed.\n\nFor three decades, Malachar conquered kingdoms, his sword thirsty and inexhaustible. But the daemon's hunger grew insatiable. On the night they came to collect their due, Malachar stood alone in his throne room, surrounded by the corpses of his own generals.

The daemons shrieked across the void.\n\nIn his final moment, Malachar understood: defiance was its own salvation.",

Thysara marked her immediatelyâfresh blood for the midnight rituals.\n\nBut Shara had walked through deserts wider than death itself.

It grew stronger, fed by her fear.\n\nIn the Tomb of Dead Merchants, Kessa made her stand. She turned to face the shadow directly and did something desperate: she embraced it. Pulled it into herself.\n\nFor a moment, she was two creatures at onceâlight and darkness, thief and pursuer. Then they merged. The curse broke.\n\nKessa emerged different. Her left half moved in darkness, her right in light. Perfect balance. She looked at the Eye of Aethon in her hand and smiled. The Sleeping God had given her more than she'd stolen: it had given her wholeness.\n\nShe walked toward the rising sun, her shadow no longer her enemy.",
